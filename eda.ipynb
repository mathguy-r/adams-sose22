       "\"Crouch End is a very hip and friendly neighbourhood.  It is filled with endless options for eating out and lots of lovely shops! Great Vietnamese restaurant Khoai Cafe, is a favourite, as is Irvin (Italian & Scottish Tapas bar!) run by the former drummer of Lloyd Cole & the Commotions. New, amazing  ice cream shop La Gelatiera will have you licking your lips and coming back for more! - but you might have to queue! Nearby Priory Road (with a lovely leafy Park just 1 min walk away) The Crouch End Broadway and surrounding streets offer a good selection of shops, trendy cafÃ©s and restaurants to choose from. Bannerâ€™s is a particularly favoured American-style restaurant on Park Road, with a dimly lit dining area and cool choice of music. The Kingâ€™s Head is a popular gastro pub with a downstairs comedy club, a popular choice with local residents. Owner's favourites: The Haberdashery is a lovely cafe on Middle Lane (5 min walk, reminiscent of NYC's Greenwich Village, which serves Italian-style\""
