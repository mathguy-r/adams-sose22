W2V, like backpropagation, is a very popular algorithm that enjoys much coverage in various blogs, youtube channels, etc. In case you appreciate some additional material to read-up on W2V, here here are some useful resources including,  \n",

    "## Training word-to-vec embeddings\n",
    "When it comes to embeddings, the most common use case is to **download pre-trained embeddings** and employ these for some downstream tasks (with or without fine-tuning). The Keras *embedding layer* supports that use case very well, as we will see in a future demo on sentiment analysis. Since this demo aims at deepening our understanding of W2V, we focus on a different use case and demonstrate the training of **customer word embeddings** using our IMDB data. \n",
    "\n",
    "You could argue that the IMDB forum exhibits a specific type of speech or jargon, and that this justifies training word embeddings for this specific corpus. In practice, using pre-trained embeddings will almost surely give better results than training embeddings from zero. However, without going into too much detail of the pros and cons of pre-training your own embeddings versus employing pre-trained embeddings, perhaps with some finetuning, the point of this section is simply to showcase how you could train from scratch if you want to. To that end, we will use a library called `Gensim`. \n",
    "\n",
    "`Gensim` is a popular library for text processing. Although maybe even more geared toward topic modeling, it offers, among others, implementations of several algorithms to learn word embeddings including *W2V*, *GloVe*, and *Fasttext*. We demonstrate training W2V embeddings using our cleaned IMDB movie review data set. Before moving on, make sure to have installed `Gensim`. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Credits and disclaimers**: many of the examples you are going to see in this section have been inspired by this very nice [Kaggle post](https://www.kaggle.com/code/pierremegret/gensim-word2vec-tutorial/notebook)."

    "### The Gensim W2V model\n",
    "Training word embeddings using `Gensim` is very easy and just a matter of calling a function. Well, the reason it takes so little code is that we have already cleaned our data and have it available as an array of texts; that is a format that `Gensim`supports. However, note that, depending on your data, the code may take quite a while to run. Again, word embeddings trained on the full 50K data set for 500 epochs are available in our course folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gensim is build for scalability. Would we use a large corpus, it were not be practical to first load all data from disk into your computer's main memory, to then process the data document by document using Gensim. Instead, it would be much more scalable to stream the data from disk. Long story short, we need a bit of infrastructure to input our review data set, which, for simplicity, we keep in a data frame, in a way that complies with what Gensim expects.  into. To that end, we build a little helper class that facilitates streaming reviews from our data frame. It would be easy to extend the helper class so as to facilitate streaming reviews from disk, or support both options. The [Gensim documentation](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/auto_examples/tutorials/run_word2vec.html#training-your-own-model) provides an example."

    "Make sure to check out the docstring of the `Word2Vec` function to discover how word vectors are trained by default. Importantly, the argument `sg` let's you chose between *skip-gram* and *cbow*. Other concepts we discussed in the lecture include accelerating computations using *hierarchical softmax* and *negative sampling*. Gensim features these through its arguments `hs` and `negative`, respectively. Obviously, tons of other functionality is available, so make sure to study the [documentation](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/models/word2vec.html?highlight=word2vec) if you plan to use the Gensim library for serious projects. Also, just to remind you, the [Kaggle post](https://www.kaggle.com/code/pierremegret/gensim-word2vec-tutorial/notebook), which inspired this notebook, has a slightly more elaborate demo of how to set up training and, specifically, how you can break down the individual steps of W2V training into smaller pieces."
